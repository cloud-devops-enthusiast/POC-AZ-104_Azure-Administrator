**Create User Accounts**

There are total three ways by which Azure AD defines user's in three ways:

Cloud Identities: These are the kind of user's which exist only inside the azure AD. These can be administrator accounts and users that you manage yourself.

Directory-Synchronized Identities: These are the user's which exist in the on-premises active directory. This whole process works with a synchronized activity that occurs via the azure AD connect which brings users to the Azure. Here the on-prem source is Windows Server AD.

Guest Users: These users exist outside of the Azure, For example account from another cloud providers or Microsoft account such as Xbox live account.
